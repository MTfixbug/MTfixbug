"Hi there! I’m a student studying Data Science at Ho Chi Minh City University of Foreign Languages and Information Technology. As an IT major, I’m passionate about using data to drive decision-making and solve complex problems. My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in relevant courses, and I’m always looking for new ways to apply my skills and knowledge.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I’m also actively involved in extracurricular activities. In my free time, I enjoy interests and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.

I’m excited to continue learning and exploring the field of Data Science, and am eager to connect with others who share my passion. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat!
